Welcome to the Warestack Platform Repository! This repository serves as a collection of project templates to help
developers kickstart their projects across a wide range of technologies, frameworks, and configurations.

## What are Blueprints?

Blueprints are comprehensive project templates designed to provide developers with a robust starting point. They include
foundational codebases, configurations, and structures tailored to various development needs, enabling you to focus on
feature development and logic implementation from day one.

## Technologies & Frameworks Supported

- **Frontend Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, Angular, etc.
- **Backend Frameworks**: Node.js, Django, Flask, etc.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kubernetes Jobs, etc.
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Keras, etc.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure templates for automating cloud infrastructure provisioning.
- **CI/CD & Automation Tools**: - **CI/CD & Automation Tools**: Workflow templates for continuous integration and
  delivery, including GitHub Actions and Composite Actions.
- ... and many more!

## How to Use a Blueprint

1. Browse the repository and locate a blueprint that matches your desired tech stack.
2. Clone the blueprint to your local environment.
3. Follow the specific README associated with that blueprint for setup instructions.
4. Start building!

## Contributing

We believe in the power of the community. If you've built or want to build a blueprint that isn't yet in this repository,
we'd love for you to contribute. Check out our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

### Labels for PRs

When creating a PR, make sure to attach appropriate labels. This helps in categorizing and reviewing PRs efficiently:

- `frontend`: For PRs related to frontend frameworks.
- `backend`: For PRs specific to backend implementations.
- `data-processing`: For PRs focused on data processing techniques and tools.
- `ml/ai`: For PRs related to artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
- `infrastructure-as-code`: For PRs related to infrastructure templates and other IaC components.
- `ci/cd`: For PRs related to continuous integration and delivery tools.
- ... (This list is extensible to accommodate emerging blueprint categories.)

## What Makes a Good Blueprint?

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Every blueprint should have a detailed README explaining how to set up, use, and
  deploy the project.
- **Maintainability**: Code should be clean, readable, and modular.
- **Scalability**: Design blueprints with scalability in mind, following best practices.
- **Security**: Basic security practices should be in place.
- **Community Driven**: We value and appreciate every PR. Community feedback and improvements help in refining the
  blueprints.
